# CommitGen CLI

# npm
npm install -g @untools/commitgen

Or run correctly via `npx` (no installation required):

## Advanced Features

### 🔄 Multi-Commit Mode

CommitGen can detect when you've modified unrelated files and suggest splitting them into multiple atomic commits.

```bash
commitgen --multi-commit
```

_The CLI will prompt you to confirm the split groups before proceeding._

### 🧠 History Learning

The tool learns from your previous commit messages to match your personal or team's style. This is enabled by default.

To disable:

```bash
commitgen --no-history
```

### 🎫 Issue Linking

If your branch name contains an issue ID (e.g., `feat/PROJ-123-new-auth`), CommitGen will automatically append the ticket reference to your commit message (e.g., `feat: add auth logic (PROJ-123)`).

To disable:

```bash
commitgen --no-issues
```
